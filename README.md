# 📚 libft

> A personal implementation of common C standard library functions — built from scratch as a foundation for future projects.

## 📘 Project Description

**libft** is the first project in the 42 curriculum. The goal is to reimplement many standard C library functions (like `strlen`, `memcpy`, `strchr`, etc.) and build your own reusable C library. It’s a foundational project that sharpens your skills in memory management, pointer manipulation, and C programming best practices.
